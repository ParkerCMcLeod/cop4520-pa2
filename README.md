### Statement:

#### Problem 1: minotaur_birthday

To address the problem, I initially brainstormed solutions on a whiteboard and recognized that guests could encode their experiences through their decisions to eat, ignore, or replace the cake. This led me to the idea of appointing a counter to track the number of eaten cakes, allowing me to determine the number of unique guests who navigated the maze. With this strategy in place, the multithreaded implementation became straightforward. Each guest is represented by a thread that sequentially enters the maze, makes decisions, and exits. After exiting, it signals the next thread based on the Minotaur's selection. This process repeats until the designated counter thread confirms all have eaten the cake.

##### Guest Logic:

A guest consumes the cupcake on their first visit unless they're the counter, who eats it only once but replaces it thereafter. If the counter finds the cupcake missing (a sign another guest has visited), they replenish it, thereby tracking visits. This method counts visits through the counter's replacements, enabling them to confirm when all guests have visited the labyrinth. The counter is then able to answer the question "can you guarantee every guest has visited?".

#### Problem 2: minotaur_vase - strategy 3

##### Strategy Selection Advantages/Disadvantages:

###### Strategy 1: Open Door Check

- Advantages: Allows guests the freedom to explore and attempt entry at any time, enhancing the party's spontaneity.
- Disadvantages: May cause overcrowding and lacks guarantees for viewing

 the vase, potentially leading to frustration.

###### Strategy 2: Availability Sign

- Advantages: Clearly shows if the showroom is open, reducing wait times at the door and promoting efficient use.
- Disadvantages: Depends on guests to update the sign correctly, which might not always occur, and doesn't solve queuing issues.

###### Strategy 3: Queue System

- Advantages: Provides organized access and guarantees turns, minimizing door crowding.
- Disadvantages: Could result in long waits and reduce guests' time to enjoy the party.

##### Conclusion:

- The queue system (Strategy 3) is the most structured, ensuring orderly access but may increase wait times. The optimal strategy depends on the event's size and guests' preference for freedom or structure.
- The implementation was straightforward.

### Proof of Correctness:

#### Problem 1: minotaur_birthday

The program outputs which guests are visiting the maze and their corresponding decisions regarding the cupcake in that visit. Using these outputs, I was able to manually verify the logic through the outputs for N selections of 1 through 5. Twice.

#### Problem 2: minotaur_vase - strategy 3

The program outputs which guests are viewing the vase and which are waiting in line. Using these outputs, I was able to manually verify the logic through the outputs for N selections of 1 through 5. Twice. Because it was a simple queue, it was not difficult to verify.

### Experimental Evaluations:

#### Problem 1: minotaur_birthday

I quickly implemented a solution that logically worked, but it was initially suboptimal. My approach had threads continuously checking their turn using atomic variables, leading to 100% CPU usage due to constant looping. To mitigate this, I introduced a delay between checks, but soon recognized that a `std::condition_variable` was the ideal solution. This C++ feature enabled me to establish an event-based waiting system for threads, significantly reducing condition checks and allowing threads to wait efficiently for their turn.

#### Problem 2: minotaur_vase - strategy 3

This solution was able to implement a subset of all the same features as the previous program in an optimal fashion, utilizing the correct C++ features for each logical requirement.
